# vawe-critique: how to look

The author never grades its own film. Run this in a session that has not seen the authoring
(`VAWE_AGENT=<name>` for a subagent). Default verdict is REJECT; the film passes only when you
cannot find a reason to reject it. Grade what is on screen, not what the film meant.

## The views, in this order

```bash
bin/vawe critique films/<name>/page.html [--ref quality/refs/<ref>/source.mp4]
```

It writes the sheet, the strip, the phone view and the loop pair, and runs the page checks. Then
look, and write one line per finding under each view:

1. **Sheet**: every frame. Is the focal point obvious in under a second? Is anything cramped,
   overlapping or unreadable? Producing a sheet is not looking at one: one line per frame.
2. **Strip**: both sides of every cut. Does the cut land on its beat? Does the eye know where to go
   after it? Does any exit run slower than its entrance?
3. **Phone**: the 9:16 render, or 16:9 at one third size. Can you read every string? Is the accent
   still one colour?
4. **Loop or end**: t=0 beside t=duration. A loop is pixel-identical; an end holds long enough to
   read.
5. **Checks**: `quality/gates/page-check.mjs` findings (readable hold, hook length, em dash, message
   and spectacle meta, aspect layout) and `bin/vawe check anim-traps <page>`.

With a reference: frame-locked. Pull the same five timestamps from both. For each pair write light,
type scale, and the curve of the one thing that moves: same or not. Anything the draft added without
a KEEP/CHANGE line is a rejection (`vawe-reference`).

## The judge

Score the seven dimensions of `engine-doctrine/JUDGE.md` (readability, hierarchy, composition, brand
fidelity, asset fidelity, produced-not-generated, value), 1 to 10. Threshold 7 on every one. Two
runs, A and B, before a beat closes; one judge is an opinion: `bin/vawe judge <page> --struct --runs A,B`. A
PASS is never self-recorded.

Name every default you recognise; each is a rejection: a particle burst, a bouncy spring, a glow, a
logo slam, a gradient on chrome, a centred title on a gradient, everything fading in, corner labels,
a crossfade where a cut belongs, fake UI, dead time that no `authoring` waiver declares.
Name the rule id of each (`no-tells`, `overshoot`, `entrance-origin`, `crossfade-limit`, `show-real-thing`,
`live-hold`); every id is in `taste/README.md`.

## The report shape

Every finding is shot + frame + fix:

```
REJECT: 7 findings, top five first.
1. [3.2s, frame 96] the stat lands on the same frame as the label; stagger the label 60 ms later.
   fix: films/x/page.html:88, delay 3200 -> 3260
2. [8.0s] exit of the card (420 ms) is slower than its entrance (300 ms). fix: line 131, 420 -> 220
...
```

End with exactly one of:

- `REJECT: <n> findings, the top five first.`
- `PASS: I looked for a reason to reject it and found none. <one sentence on what is best>`

A finding with no file and line is a complaint, not a critique. The critic proposes; the author
decides.

## After the critique (the author)

- Fix the top five (the top three for a short film). Re-render only the seconds they name:
  `bin/vawe dev films/<name>/page.html --from <s> --to <s>`.
- Then a fresh critique again. Stop when it passes, or when two rounds in a row fix nothing the
  critic scores higher. Hand back with the last critique attached.
- Findings are fixed, not moved: the next critic gets the previous report and checks.

## The critic prompt, and the panel

Hand a fresh agent this and nothing else about the authoring: "You are the critic. You have not seen how this film was made. Film: <page>, rendered at <mp4>. Reference: <ref or none>. Brief: <brief.md>. Default verdict is REJECT; do not fill in what the film meant. Look at the four views in order, one line per finding; frame-locked against the reference at five shared timestamps if there is one; score the seven dimensions; name every default you recognise; end with the REJECT or PASS line." Ask the author five things first, each with a default: the mp4 (the last draft), the brief (`brief.md`), the reference (none), the previous critique (none; the critic checks findings were fixed, not moved), the judges (two, A and B).

A fresh critic matters because the thread that wrote the page has anchored on its own easing, crop and headline. Its value is independent evidence: judge by what artifact it sees that the author did not (a render, a strip, a reference), not by a fresh pair of eyes. For a panel, hand each critic one artifact and demand a fixed verdict shape:

| critic | input | verdict per item |
|---|---|---|
| beat | the phone sheet and strip of `bin/vawe critique` | `{beat, reads, flaw, fix}` |
| bg-motion | a strip of 4 or more frames, reference and render at matched times (a still says nothing about speed) | `{axis, ours, reference, delta, fix}` |
| reveal | a dense strip of the entrance and exit windows | `{beat, enter, exit, paired, flaw, fix}` |
| fidelity (recreations) | `bin/vawe compare` frames | `{beat, score 0-10, gaps}` (gaps, not agreement) |
| seam | the seam frames and the loop seam | `{seam, flash, evidence, fix}` |

Launch the panel in one message so the critics run at once. Critics report, the main thread fixes. A critic is evidence, not a ruling: if you look and the flaw is not there, it is wrong. A panel suits a full authoring pass, a recreation and any render you ship; a colour swap is not worth it. The fan-out cost and the brief lines for any subagent: `engine-doctrine/CRAFT/SUBAGENTS.md`. Judge dimensions: `engine-doctrine/JUDGE.md`.
