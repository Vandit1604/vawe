# UI focus zoom

**Use when** a captured screen is on and one part of it is the point: a status, a button, a number.
The cursor lands on the part first, then the whole screen scales until that part fills about a third
of the frame width and its centre sits in the middle. The camera is one `translate` and one `scale`
on the same ease, so the target travels straight to the centre. Clip:
[ui-focus-zoom.mp4](ui-focus-zoom.mp4). Demo: [demo/ui-focus-zoom.html](demo/ui-focus-zoom.html).
(The window in the demo is a stand-in; on a real film the world is the capture.)

```js
import { EASE } from '../../core/motion/presets.js';
const world = document.querySelector('.world');            // transform-origin: 0 0
const r = target.getBoundingClientRect();                   // measured before any animation runs
const W = innerWidth, H = innerHeight;
const s = (0.36 * W) / r.width;                             // the target fills 36% of the frame width
const tx = W * 0.5 - s * (r.left + r.width / 2), ty = H * 0.5 - s * (r.top + r.height / 2);
cursor.animate([{ translate: '-16vw 12vh' }, { translate: '0 0' }],
  { duration: 500, delay: 50, easing: EASE.land, fill: 'both' });
world.animate([{ translate: '0 0', scale: 1 }, { translate: `${tx}px ${ty}px`, scale: s }],
  { duration: 1000, delay: 550, easing: EASE.land, fill: 'both' });
```

Sound: none; the cursor landing is the cue's job in cursor-click, and the zoom itself is silent.

The individual `translate` and `scale` properties apply as translate then scale from the origin, so
`p -> t + s * p` and the target lands exactly on the frame centre. Measure the rect once at load,
never per frame. Start the camera 50 ms after the cursor lands, so the eye is on the target when the
move begins. A scale of 2.5 to 4 reads as a zoom; past 5 the capture goes soft. `EASE.land`
gives a fast start and a long soft arrival; use `EASE.settle` for a calmer film. Cut back out on the next
beat, never zoom back on a mirror curve.
If a pan-stations camera owns the `.world`, fold the zoom into that camera's one `translate` and `scale`: two transforms on one world stack, and the target lands off centre.

Looks (ground, type, radius, accent) live in `demo/demo.css`; this snippet keeps neutral tokens.
