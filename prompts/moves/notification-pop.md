# Notification pop

**Use when** the product tells the user something finished: a render, a payment, a message. A copy
of a real phone notification banner: a phone with a photo wallpaper and a home screen, and a banner
with the app icon, a bold title, the time (`now`), a two-line body and the small grab handle. The
banner is a translucent material over a blurred backdrop. It drops from above the screen on a
spring with a small settle, is read for about three seconds, then swipes up and out. Clip:
[notification-pop.mp4](notification-pop.mp4) (5.6 s, light; `notification-pop-dark.mp4` is the dark
theme). Demo: [demo/notification-pop.html](demo/notification-pop.html).

```js
import { track } from '../../core/motion/springs.js';
// the system spring: stiffness 300, damping 26 (ratio 0.75, about 3 percent settle); the banner starts fully above the screen
// the position is a pure function of t, set each frame (see the note below)
const exit = clamp((ms - 4400) / 320);                      // the swipe out is shorter and accelerates: 320 ms, cubic in
const drop = exit > 0 ? 200 * exit ** 3 : 200 * (1 - track(t, [[0, 0], [0.9, 1]], 300, 26));
banner.style.translate = `0 ${-drop}%`;                      // percent of the banner's own height
```

```css
.banner { background: rgba(246, 246, 246, 0.74); backdrop-filter: blur(30pt) saturate(1.8); border-radius: 26pt; }   /* pt = screen width / 393 */
```

Sound: droplet when the banner lands (about 0.2 s after it starts); nothing on the swipe.

## How it looks and moves

- Real proportions, in points of a 393 pt wide screen: banner inset 12 pt, top 56 pt (under the
  Dynamic Island), radius 26 pt, padding 14 by 16 pt, icon 38 pt with a 9 pt radius, title 15 pt
  semibold, body 15 pt, `now` 13 pt. The phone is 92 u wide (92 percent of the frame height) and
  runs off the bottom of the frame, so the banner text reads at 3.4 u.
- The screen is a wallpaper photo, a status bar, the Dynamic Island and twelve generic apps (flat
  colour, one white glyph). Our own app icon, title and file name: no real app or brand.
- Only the banner moves. The contents do not stagger: the real banner arrives as one object.
- The phone fades in and out as clip framing.
- The banner is driven by `vawe.onFrame`, not by a WAAPI animation: a `translate` animation on an element with `backdrop-filter` does not show in the rendered clip until it ends.

Inter stands in for the system face.
