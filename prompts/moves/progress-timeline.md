# Progress timeline

**Use when** an export, a render or an upload ends and the product shows the result in an editor. A loading bar fills and does not stop at its
end: the fill keeps going, its tail catches up with its head, the head stands up into a thin vertical line, and that line is the scrubber of a
video timeline. The scrubber reveals the timeline as it moves, and it keeps the speed the fill had. One object, one speed, two screens.
Clip: [progress-timeline.mp4](progress-timeline.mp4). Demo: [demo/progress-timeline.html](demo/progress-timeline.html).

```js
// one speed curve for the whole move: accelerate, run at V, brake at the end of the timeline
const X0 = 10 * vw, END = 50 * vw, REST = 92 * vw, V = 44 * vw, T0 = 0.4, ACC = 0.5, BRAKE = 0.6;
const x = xAt(t);                                                          // piecewise integral of that speed
const past = clamp((t - tEnd) / 0.7);                                      // tEnd: the second x passes the end of the track
const tail = lerp(X0, x - LINE_W, swap(clamp(past / 0.55)));               // the tail catches up with the head
const h = lerp(1.4 * u, 50 * u, land(clamp((past - 0.4) / 0.6)));          // then the head stands up
head.style.cssText = `left:${tail}px; width:${Math.max(x - tail, LINE_W)}px; height:${h}px; top:${CY - h / 2}px`;
timeline.style.clipPath = past > 0.75 ? `inset(0 ${W - x - LINE_W}px 0 ${edge}px)` : 'inset(0 100% 0 100%)';
```

Sound: a soft tick when the line is up (`past` 1), a low tone under the scrub that stops when the line brakes.

- The speed matches because there is one `xAt(t)`. The fill and the scrubber read the same function, so the head never jumps in
  speed at the end of the track. 44 vw per second at the end of the track is the number that read well; slower looks stuck, faster loses the stand-up.
- Order inside the stand-up (0.7 s): first the width collapses (`EASE.swap`, 0 to 55 percent), so the fill is a dash, then the
  height grows (`EASE.land`, 40 to 100 percent). Both at once make a fat pill; the dash is the beat that says "the bar is becoming a line".
- The timeline is revealed to the left of the scrubber only: its right edge is the line, its left edge flies to 0 in the last 25 percent of
  the stand-up on `EASE.launch`. Anything to the right of the line is still shot A (the thumbnail), so the scrubber visibly plays across it.
  Keep the thumbnail dim: a thumbnail in the accent colour hides the line.
- Z-order: A z 1, B z 2, scrubber and time code z 8 and 9. The time code is a function of the same `x`, in a pill so it reads on both sides.
- The scrubber brakes on `0.6 s` and rests at 92 vw, so B is fully shown. If it rests earlier, a strip of A stays at the right.
- What goes wrong: a horizontal bar that rotates 90 degrees is a spin, not a handoff, and it breaks the speed. A scrubber line that
  is thicker than 0.7 u reads as a bar. Do not fade the bar out.

Looks (ground, type, radius, accent) live in `demo/demo.css`; this snippet keeps neutral tokens.
