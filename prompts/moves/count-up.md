# Count up

**Use when** a number is the proof: a revenue, a user count, a render time. Each digit is a wheel
that rolls to its value, so the digits never change width and never scramble; the wheels on the
right spin further and land last, and each wheel carries a vertical blur that follows its own
speed. A delta chip slides in when the number lands and a sparkline draws to the end. Clip:

import { curveToLinear, CURVES } from '../../core/motion/springs.js';
const settle = curveToLinear(CURVES.expoOut);
const loops = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3];   // full turns per digit; more turns on the right
// per digit d: a strip of 10 * (loops + 1) numerals in a clipped cell, and a filter of its own
const steps = loops[d] * 10 + digit, t0 = 0.1 + d * 0.045, dur = 1.15;
strip.animate([{ translate: '0 0' }, { translate: `0 ${-steps * 1.16}em` }], { duration: dur * 1000, delay: t0 * 1000, easing: settle, fill: 'both' });
vawe.onFrame((t) => {   // SVG filters cannot be keyframed: blur y by half a frame of this wheel's travel
  const u = Math.min(1, Math.max(0, (t - t0) / dur)), du = 1 / 240;
  const slope = (CURVES.expoOut(Math.min(1, u + du)) - CURVES.expoOut(u)) / du;
  blur.setAttribute('stdDeviation', `0 ${(u > 0 && u < 1 ? (slope / dur) * travel / 60 * 0.5 : 0).toFixed(2)}`);
});

`travel` is `steps * 1.16 * fontSize` in px. Wheels start 45 ms apart, inside the 30 to 80 ms band, so the
group never lands on one frame. The wheels are not a font trick: a plain text counter shifts
width as digits change and reads as a glitch, and the wheel keeps every column fixed. The soft
mask on the cell edges is what makes a passing digit look like it rolls off, not like it is cut.
Commas and the currency sign are static, so the eye tracks only the digits. The chip and the
sparkline are the last-frame motion; the number is the only bright thing until it lands.
