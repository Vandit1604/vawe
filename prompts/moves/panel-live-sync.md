# Panel live sync

**Use when** the feature is editing with instant feedback: a visual editor, an inspector, a design tool.
The page holds two surfaces in one frame, a target (a button on a page) and a panel of controls. A
cursor presses a field and scrubs it, and the field's number and the target change in the same frame,
three beats in a row (rotate, radius, padding). The claim is the causality: one gesture, two surfaces,
no lag. Clip: [panel-live-sync.mp4](panel-live-sync.mp4). Demo: [demo/panel-live-sync.html](demo/panel-live-sync.html).

```js
import '../../core/engine/page-api.js';
const smooth = (u) => u * u * (3 - 2 * u), clamp = (u) => Math.min(1, Math.max(0, u)), lerp = (a, b, u) => a + (b - a) * u;
const seg = (t, a, b) => smooth(clamp((t - a) / (b - a)));
// one gesture per beat: glide to a field, press, scrub, release (seconds); values hold between beats
const beats = [
  { k: 'rot', glide: [0.35, 0.8], press: 0.86, scrub: [0.9, 1.45], release: 1.55 },
  { k: 'rad', glide: [1.55, 1.9], press: 1.95, scrub: [2.0, 2.55], release: 2.65 },
];
const value = { rot: (t) => lerp(0, -9, seg(t, ...beats[0].scrub)), rad: (t) => lerp(14, 58, seg(t, ...beats[1].scrub)) };

vawe.onFrame((t) => {
  const rot = value.rot(t), rad = value.rad(t);
  // the control and the target read the same numbers in the same frame, so they cannot drift apart
  target.style.rotate = `${rot}deg`;
  target.style.borderRadius = `${rad / 10.8}vh`;
  fields.rot.textContent = `${Math.round(rot)} deg`;
  fields.rad.textContent = `${Math.round(rad)} px`;
  for (const b of beats) fields[b.k].classList.toggle('on', t >= b.press && t < b.release);   // accent ring while pressed
  const [x, y] = cursorAt(t);   // glide on a smoothstep, then ride the scrub to the right
  cursor.style.translate = `${x}px ${y}px`;
  cursor.firstChild.style.scale = beats.some((b) => t >= b.press && t < b.release) ? 0.86 : 1;
});
```

Sound: none; a scrub is silent, and a tick per value reads as a machine.

Drive the cursor, the field text and the target from one `vawe.onFrame`, not from separate animations:
two tweens that share a start time still drift when one is edited, and one function cannot. Keep both
surfaces fully in frame for the whole clip; a zoom that crops the target out breaks the claim. Show
the value with its unit (`-9 deg`, `58 px`) in a mono face with tabular figures so the digits do not
jitter. Scrub to the right by about 7 percent of the frame width so the drag is visible on the cursor.
Measure the field positions with `getBoundingClientRect` before any animation starts, since an
entrance translate would shift them. The target wears a dashed outline (selection chrome) so the viewer
knows what is bound.

Looks (ground, type, radius, accent) live in `demo/demo.css`; this snippet keeps neutral tokens.
