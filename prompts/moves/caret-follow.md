# Caret follow

**Use when** a command or a line is typed and the camera is close enough that the line runs past the
frame. The camera does not pan on a timer: it is a spring behind the caret, so it trails by a
fraction of a second, speeds up on a burst of letters and rests on a pause. The text behind the caret
stays in view and the text ahead of it is never shown early. It is the terminal camera of the
vawe-flow-2 film. Clip: [caret-follow.mp4](caret-follow.mp4). Demo: [demo/caret-follow.html](demo/caret-follow.html).

```js
import '../../core/engine/page-api.js';
import { track, rng } from '../../core/motion/springs.js';
const s = 1.9, ch = caret.getBoundingClientRect().width;     // monospace: a caret is one character wide
const x0 = line.left + promptWidth, y = line.top + line.height / 2, winLeft = win.getBoundingClientRect().left;
const rand = rng(7);                                          // seeded: the same rhythm on every render
let clock = 0.2;
const at = [...text].map((c) => { clock += 0.026 + rand() * 0.024 + (c === ' ' ? 0.07 : 0); return clock; });
const keys = [[0, x0], ...at.map((t, i) => [t, x0 + (i + 1) * ch])];   // the caret x after each character

vawe.onFrame((t) => {
  const n = at.filter((a) => a <= t).length;                  // characters typed at t; show text.slice(0, n)
  const follow = track(t, keys, 90, 20);                      // one soft spring per character
  const tx = Math.min(W * 0.66 - s * follow, W * 0.05 - s * winLeft);   // caret rests at 66% of the width; never show past the window edge
  world.style.transform = `translate(${tx}px, ${H * 0.5 - s * y}px) scale(${s})`;   // world { transform-origin: 0 0 }
});
```

The stiffness is the feel: `track(t, keys, 90, 20)` trails by about 0.2 s (2 x damping ratio / natural frequency). At `k` 170 the camera
locks to every letter and shakes; under 60 it drifts behind the text. The caret rests at two thirds
of the width so the eye reads the last 15 or so characters. The `min()` stops the camera from showing
the empty ground left of the window at the start. Every input is a function of `t`, so the frame
does not depend on the last one. Blink only after the typing ends, so the tail is alive.
