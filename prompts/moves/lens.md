# Lens

**Use when** a screen (a terminal, a dashboard, a tracking HUD, a type line shown as a monitor) must read as a
real object filmed by a camera: tilted, soft at one end, bright glyphs blooming, LED cells and colour fringes
visible when the camera pushes in. Render the flat screen, then let one shader film it. Clip:
[lens.mp4](lens.mp4). Demo: [demo/lens.html](demo/lens.html). Code: `core/surfaces/lens.js`.

The six stages of the clip, each turned on for one second: flat, perspective, depth of field, palette and
aberration, bloom and LED grid, tear and grain with the camera tracker.

```js
import { lens, htmlSource, PALETTES, OFF } from '/core/surfaces/lens.js';
const cam = lens(htmlSource(document.getElementById('screen'), { scale: 2 }), {
  aim: (t) => [1390, 520], zoom: (t) => 1 + 1.9 * ease(t), tiltY: 0.38, tiltX: 0.1,
  dof: { blur: 0.55, focus: [1400, 520] },
  palette: { stops: PALETTES.thermal, keepColor: 0.9 },
  bloom: { strength: 0.9, radius: 42 }, grid: { amount: 0.9, cell: 3 },
  aberration: { amount: (t) => 6 + 8 * lock(t) },
  tear: { amount: (t) => (hit(t) ? 70 : 0) },
});
vawe.onFrame((t) => cam.draw(t));            // the seek awaits it
const p = cam.project(1498, 440, t);         // { x, y, scale, depth, visible } in CSS px: put a label there
```

Sound: a short noise tick at each tear, and a low thud on a lock (aberration peak). The lens itself is silent.

## What it does

- The screen is `#screen`: plain HTML and CSS, 1920 by 1080 px, parked behind the lens canvas. `htmlSource`
  inlines its computed styles and fonts into an SVG image and uploads it every seek. `canvasSource(canvas)`
  takes a 2D canvas instead.
- Every option is a literal the page can change: a number, an array, or a function of the seek time. The
  defaults are the "filmed screen" look; `OFF` flattens every effect so one can be turned on alone.
- `perspective`: `tiltX`, `tiltY`, `roll`, `zoom` (up to about 3), `aim` (the source point at the middle).
  A ray hits a tilted plane, so the far side is smaller and softer by geometry, not by a CSS skew.
- `dof`: blur grows with the depth difference to `focus` (a source point: pass a function to follow a
  target). Bokeh takes the aperture's shape: `blades` (n-gon), `rotation`, `roundness`, and `catEye`
  squeezes it toward the frame edge. Bright pixels weigh more in the taps. `soft` is the lens floor.
  A source with a `depth` input (below) blurs by each pixel's own depth instead of the tilted plane.
- `palette`: brightness through 2 to 8 colour stops (`PALETTES.thermal phosphor amber navy paper mono cyanotype`).
  `keepColor` leaves saturated marks (a red lock box) in their own colour.
- Light is linear from the first tap to the last pass. `grid` is a panel mask on the screen plane: a soft
  dot per subpixel (`layout` stripe, triad or dot, `softness`), the same shape per channel so the
  average colour stays untinted. It follows the plane (period changes with zoom and tilt), fades out of
  focus, and is applied before bloom, so bright dots bleed into each other.
- `bloom`: soft-knee threshold, then a 6-level downsample and upsample chain weighted by `radius`: a
  tight core plus a wide tail. `aberration`: red and blue move apart radially, `amount` px at the edge.
- `halation`: the warm halo film gets where a bright edge meets dark. Pixels above `threshold` (0.6) go through
  the same blur chain as bloom at a wider `radius` (90 px), are multiplied by `tint` (default `[1, 0.3, 0.1]`,
  a red-orange; pass `[0.1, 0.4, 1]` for a cold halo) and added only where the base is dark, so bright areas
  keep their colour. `strength` is 0 by default and in `OFF`: turn it on with about 0.5 to 1.2.
- `PALETTES.cyanotype`: six stops measured from a reference image, dark to light: `#010306 #070d13 #162432
  #3b4f64 #6f8599 #ccd8e4`. A near-black blue ground with a pale blue-grey top.
- Optical effects, all off by default and in `OFF` (strength, amount or blur 0). Each one reads like a lens part:
  - `streaks: { strength, length, threshold, tint }`: anamorphic streaks. Pixels above `threshold` (0.7) go through
    the same blur chain as bloom, but the chain halves only the width, so a bright point becomes a thin
    horizontal line `length` px long (600), multiplied by `tint` (default blue) and added. Use about 0.3 to 1.
  - `diffusion: { strength, radius }`: Pro-Mist. A low-threshold wide glow (`radius` 70 px) added over the whole
    image, plus a very small black lift, so the blacks beside bright areas rise. Use about 0.2 to 0.5.
  - `softFocus: { amount, radius }`: the image mixed with a blurred copy of itself (`radius` 16 px). The core
    stays, the detail softens. Use `amount` 0.2 to 0.6.
  - `tiltShift: { center, width, blur }`: a sharp band (`center` and `width` are shares of the view height) with
    blur rising above and below it to `blur` px. It uses the circle-of-confusion path of `dof`, with the
    screen row as a synthetic depth. A source with its own `depth` keeps that depth and gets the band blur as a floor.
  - `distortion: { amount }`: a radial remap of the sample point. Above 0 is barrel (corners pulled in), below 0
    is pincushion. Use -0.12 to 0.12. `project()` and `quad()` follow it.
  - `weave: { amount }`: gate weave. The whole image moves by up to `amount` px, a new seeded offset every
    frame (`seed`, `fps`). `project()` follows it.
- `tear` (rows slide, seeded), `grain`, `vignette`, `exposure`, `lift`, `fade`. All noise is hashed from
  `seed` and `floor(t * fps)`: a frame is a pure function of t, so renders match byte for byte.
- `project(x, y, t)` is the same camera on the CPU. Labels, links and brackets drawn in HTML on top
  of the canvas (z-index above 0) stay sharp and show real source coordinates.

## The numbers

The demo was measured against a reference, 1080p: bloom 90 to 10 percent width
24.9 px (reference 20.7), panel period 6.9 px (reference 7.1), colour fringe 35 percent of edges off by 1
px or more (reference 20 to 28). At 1080p a frame costs about 17 ms on the GPU (12 ms in a draft), and a
6 s final (360 frames) captures in about 20 s.

## Looks

A look is a named set of lens options, data in `LOOKS` (`core/surfaces/lens.js`, next to `PALETTES`).
`lens(source, { look: 'film-halation', ...own })` starts from a flat lens, switches on the look, then puts the
page's own options over it: a page option always wins. A page with no `look` keeps the filmed-screen defaults.
Choose by sight: `bin/vawe frames <page> --looks --at 4.5,9 [--only a,b] [--out dir]` films the page frame at each second
under every look and as-is, and writes one labelled grid per second (draft size, so a fine `grid` cell shows only in a final).
The verb sets `window.__vaweLensOverride` before the page runs. `lens()` merges it over the page options, and it
holds a full look: every effect the look does not name is off, while `aim`, `zoom`, tilt and `dof` stay the page's. Only the verb sets it.

| look | what it does | numbers |
|---|---|---|
| `clean` | every effect off: the flat screen with the page's camera | none |
| `dream-bloom` | a wide, strong glow and a little soft focus | bloom 1.5, radius 120, threshold 0.22; softFocus 0.18, radius 30; vignette 0.15; lift 0.01 |
| `film-halation` | the red-orange halo of film around bright edges | halation 1, radius 90, threshold 0.55; bloom 0.35; grain 0.05; vignette 0.25 |
| `anamorphic` | blue horizontal streaks off bright shapes, a slight colour fringe | streaks 0.9, length 800, threshold 0.45, tint [0.35, 0.6, 1]; bloom 0.3; aberration 3; vignette 0.2 |
| `pro-mist` | a soft veil: glow over the whole image and lifted blacks | diffusion 0.35, radius 70; vignette 0.1 |
| `tilt-shift` | a sharp middle band, blur above and below | tiltShift center 0.5, width 0.3, blur 22 |
| `soft-focus` | the whole image mixed half with a blurred copy | softFocus 0.5, radius 14 |
| `vintage` | warm tone, grain, weave, strong vignette, soft halo | palette warm 4 stops at 0.4; halation 0.5; bloom 0.3; grain 0.09; weave 1.6; vignette 0.55; lift 0.02 |
| `cyanotype` | the cyanotype palette, a cold halo, grain | PALETTES.cyanotype; halation 0.8, tint [0.1, 0.4, 1]; grain 0.07; vignette 0.3 |
| `crt` | LED stripe grid, torn rows, colour fringe, strong bloom | grid 0.9, cell 3; tear 6, prob 0.04; aberration 5; bloom 0.7; vignette 0.5; grain 0.04 |

## Depth of field for a 3D scene

A tilted plane gives depth by geometry. A three.js scene has depth per pixel, so give the lens that depth:
`canvasSource(color, { depth })`. `depth` is a canvas (or ImageBitmap, ImageData) holding linear depth in the red
channel, 0 near to 1 far, or a function returning one, called on every draw. It may have another size than the
colour canvas. The circle of confusion is `blur` x `|depth - focus|`, so `dof.focus` is a depth number (0 to 1; a
function of t racks it) or a source point whose depth is read. `max`, `bokeh`, `blades`, `soft` keep their meaning.
A sharp near object does not smear into the blurred far one; a blurred near object spreads over the far one.
Without `depth` the plane path runs unchanged. Depth is 8 bit here: avoid a range wider than the scene needs.

```js
const color = Object.assign(document.createElement('canvas'), { width: 1920, height: 1080 });
const depth = Object.assign(document.createElement('canvas'), { width: 1920, height: 1080 });
const depthMat = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({   // linear view depth, not the nonlinear depth buffer
  uniforms: { near: { value: camera.near }, far: { value: camera.far } },
  vertexShader: 'varying float v; void main() { vec4 m = modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0); v = -m.z; gl_Position = projectionMatrix * m; }',
  fragmentShader: 'uniform float near, far; varying float v; void main() { gl_FragColor = vec4(vec3(clamp((v - near) / (far - near), 0.0, 1.0)), 1.0); }',
});
function renderBoth(t) {
  scene.background = beautyBackground; scene.overrideMaterial = null;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
  color.getContext('2d').drawImage(renderer.domElement, 0, 0);
  scene.background = new THREE.Color(1, 1, 1); scene.overrideMaterial = depthMat;   // far = white
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
  depth.getContext('2d').drawImage(renderer.domElement, 0, 0);
  scene.overrideMaterial = null;
}
const cam = lens(canvasSource(color, { depth }), { dof: { blur: 0.6, focus: (t) => rack(t) } });   // rack: depth 0..1
vawe.onFrame(async (t) => { update(t); renderBoth(t); await cam.draw(t); });
```

Set the renderer's `preserveDrawingBuffer: true` or copy right after each render, as above. Lights and fog do
not touch the override material, so the depth stays a pure function of the geometry.

## Rejected approximations

These faked one effect per element and never matched a camera:
- `text-shadow` or `filter: drop-shadow` as bloom: the glow follows the glyph shape, ignores the rest of
  the frame, and cannot be lifted by what sits next to it. Use `bloom`.
- A repeating-gradient overlay as the pixel grid: it does not follow perspective, does not fade out of
  focus and tints the average colour. Use `grid`.
- One `filter: blur()` as depth of field: a uniform blur has no depth. Use `dof` over a tilted plane.
- Depth bands by screen height as the depth of a 3D scene: a subject that crosses a band gets the wrong blur. Pass `depth` to `canvasSource`.
- CSS `transform: perspective() rotate3d()` on the screen: a skew of the layer, one blur per plane,
  sharp text on the far side. Use `tiltX`, `tiltY` and `zoom`.
- `mix-blend-mode` colour layers as a palette: use `palette`.

## Views and movements (product shot)

`core/surfaces/lens-views.js` holds the presets of a product shot as data and pure helpers, so a page names a view instead of writing angles. Angles are degrees as CSS
reads them; `lensPose(pose)` gives `tiltX`, `tiltY`, `roll`, `zoom`. The numbers come from a measured study of a product-shot tool (its four perspective presets, and its screen movement
ranges with its clamp of 25 degrees on rotateX and rotateY); the source is recorded at the top of the file.

```js
import { view, viewScaled, lensPose, moveBetween, backdropFor, shadowFor } from '/core/surfaces/lens-views.js';
const orbit = moveBetween('soft-orbit', 3, { scale: 0.6 });   // { from, to } poses, seeded, x and y clamped to 25 degrees
const away = viewScaled('reverse-isometric', 0.5);            // 10 and 22.5 degrees
const backdrop = backdropFor(pageEdgeRgb);                    // the page's edge colour, a little lighter on a dark page
const cue = shadowFor(backdrop, pageEdgeRgb);                 // layers, rim light and reflection that read on that backdrop
```

- Views: `flat`, `side-angle`, `isometric`, `top-diagonal`, `reverse-isometric`. Movements: `soft-orbit`, `side-drift`, `focus-push`, `focus-pull`, `diagonal-rise`, `angle-settle`, `close-orbit`, `wide-sweep`, `isometric-glide`, `isometric-reveal`. The same name and seed give the same move.
- `shadowFor`: a light backdrop (luminance 0.18 or more) gets the plain soft shadow. A dark one swallows it, so it gets layers of alpha 0.7 and 0.85, a rim light on the page edge (alpha 0.3) and a faint reflection (alpha 0.07). Draw them in the page; lens does not.
- Keep text readable: reading poses stay within 10 degrees, a start within about 15. Put the lens `dof.focus` on what the viewer must read (a function of t) and push `zoom` and `aim` to it; keep `dof.blur` near 0.45 so only the far edge softens.
- A real screen keeps the real-surface rule: the plane and the camera move, the page moves only as it does. Example: `films/easing-page/page.html`.

## Never lose the screen

A tilted plane can swing its border into the frame or turn away from the target. `edge: 'extend'` (the
default) repeats the screen's edge pixels past the border; `edge: 'black'` shows `outside`. `fit` moves
the camera instead: `fit: { keep: [x, y], margin: 80 }` pans (then zooms out) until the point holds
inside the frame, and `cover: true` until no border shows. `cam.project(x, y, t).visible` and
`cam.quad(t)` (the four screen corners in CSS px) let a check warn when a shot loses its target.

## Limits

`htmlSource` needs everything inside the screen to be self-contained: fonts from the page's `@font-face`,
images and `url()` backgrounds are inlined; `<video>`, `<iframe>` and CSS counters are not carried. Set
`scale: 2` when `zoom` goes above 1.5, or small text turns soft. A page with a lens needs WebGL2.
