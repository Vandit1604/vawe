# Underline draw

**Use when** one key word needs emphasis after it lands: a line draws under it from left to right,
fast at the start and slow at the end, like a pen. Clip: [underline-draw.mp4](underline-draw.mp4).
Demo: [demo/underline-draw.html](demo/underline-draw.html).

```css
.key { position: relative; display: inline-block; }
.key svg { position: absolute; left: -0.02em; top: 100%; width: 104%; height: 0.24em; overflow: visible; }
.key path { fill: none; stroke: var(--accent); stroke-width: 7; stroke-linecap: round;
            stroke-dasharray: 1; stroke-dashoffset: 1;
            animation-name: draw; animation-duration: 0.6s; animation-delay: var(--beat-1);
            animation-timing-function: var(--draw); animation-fill-mode: both; }
@keyframes draw { to { stroke-dashoffset: 0; } }
```

```html
<span class="key">noticed<svg viewBox="0 0 300 20" preserveAspectRatio="none"><path pathLength="1" d="M4 12 C 70 5, 190 4, 296 9"/></svg></span>
```

`--draw` is `curveToLinear(CURVES.expoOut)`. `pathLength="1"` lets the dash be 1 whatever the real
length is, so the same two lines work for any path.

## The numbers that make it look expensive

- 0.6 s on `expoOut`: two thirds of the line is out in the first 0.15 s, the last third takes the rest.
- The path is a slight curve (ends 5 units apart in a 20 unit box), not a ruler line. A straight
  line reads as a border.
- Round caps, and a stroke about 0.06em thick at this size. Thin lines vanish in a 640 px clip.
- The line starts 0.1 to 0.2 s after the word is readable, so the word lands first.

## The common mistake

Placing the line at the baseline. It strikes through descenders (g, y, p). `top: 100%` on a
`line-height: 1.2` box puts it below them. Also: `preserveAspectRatio="none"` stretches the stroke
with the box. For a very long word, draw the SVG at real pixel size instead.

Looks (ground, type, radius, accent) live in `demo/demo.css`; this snippet keeps neutral tokens.
