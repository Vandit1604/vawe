# Brand or product launch from a URL, with real assets

**Use when** a real product, company or site is the subject and the film must show it as it is:
its own colours, its own type, its own screens. Never invented UI.

**Length:** 15 to 40 seconds. Under 15 seconds, use one continuous action.

## The template

```
<inputs>
Ask me for: the site URL, the one-line promise, 3 to 5 moments in the product worth showing, the
platform (16:9 or 9:16) and length, and a song or "no music". If I skip one, take the default from
the Questions section and go on. Then run `node scripts/brand/kit.mjs <url> <name> --init`: it writes
assets/brands/<brand>/kit.json with the site's own palette, fonts and favicon. Use nothing else.
</inputs>

<task>
Name the product, who sees the film, the one message in under 12 words, and the spectacle second: the
one big moment, with 1.5 s of quiet before it.
</task>

<look>
Ground, ink and accent as hex, taken from kit.json: never improve them. Typeface and weight from the
kit. The hook's cap height as a percent of frame height; every other line 6% or more. For each real
capture: its crop, corner radius and shadow in px. Real captures only: every screen is a capture of
the real site or app, never a placeholder card. One camera language for the whole film.
</look>

<spec>
Write the three tables before any code. Shots: one row per beat (the hook, then one move per beat: the
hook word becomes the product; a cursor does one real thing; the key output, big; the second surface;
a stat you can source; the wordmark), with the real capture that proves the beat in "the viewer
notices". Words: every on-screen string with its appear and settle seconds, cap height, position and
colour. Objects: every capture and cursor with its in, settle and out seconds. The last beat keeps
the world moving: no still tail. For 20 to 30 s, start from a chain in `prompts/moves/RECIPES.md`
(Complete videos), keep its `invent` row and design that beat yourself.
</spec>

<build>
1. One page: films/<name>/page.html, <meta name="duration" content="<s>">. Relative asset paths.
2. Time is the seek. Either CSS @keyframes and element.animate() (the renderer seeks them), or
   window.seek(t) with every style computed from t. No timers, no state carried between frames.
3. Captures live in films/<name>/assets/. Each capture is a real screenshot with its source URL in a
   comment next to the <img>.
4. Audio is <audio data-at="…"> elements, never played live. Soft ticks on a few key moments:
   <audio data-synth="pluck" data-at="1.85" data-gain="-8"> (the same number the CSS --beat-2
   holds; every delay in that beat reads it), and one swell (-6 dB) into the big cut. Music: <audio src="music.mp3" data-at="0"
   data-gain="-3" data-fade-out="0.4">. Sound is felt, not noticed.
5. Draft before polish: bin/vawe dev films/<name>/page.html. Read the sheet. Fix what is
   cramped, overlapping or unreadable before any motion work.
</build>

<pitfalls>
The brand's accent on its dark surface may fail contrast (the kit says which pair to use). A capture
scaled below 0.6 loses its type; crop instead. Never set opacity or filter on a preserve-3d element;
fade its wrapper. A feature you did not see on the site is a feature you must not show.
</pitfalls>
```

## Questions

Ask in this order; the first changes the film most. A skipped question takes its default; never wait.

1. **URL**: which site or product is the subject? Default: `site/app/` (vawe's own site, served locally). Why: the kit, every capture and every colour come from it; nothing invented may appear.
2. **Promise**: the one line the film proves, under 12 words? Default: the site's own hero headline, verbatim. Why: it is the first frame and the hook, and every beat has to prove it.
3. **Moments**: which 3 to 5 things does the film show the product doing? Default: the first three surfaces the hero links to. Why: density is information per frame; each moment is one beat with one real capture.
4. **Platform**: 16:9 or 9:16, and how long? Default: 16:9, 24 s. Why: the canvas decides the layout and the pace; a reel is one column, a launch is a stage.
5. **Music**: a licensed song file, or synth cues only? Default: synth cues, no music. Why: a song sets the beat grid; without one the cuts follow the picture.

A claim that needs a source (a number, a customer name) gets its source before the beat list.

## Gotchas

- `scripts/brand/kit.mjs` builds the kit from the site's own colours only. Do not "improve" the palette.
- Density is information per frame: show the product working, not slogans on black.
- A launch film's logo is prominent early and late, not only at the end.
- Adjacent transitions change axis or direction (house rule). Three slide-lefts in a row read as a
  template.

## Worked example (vawe)

URL `site/app/` (local), promise "Write a scene. Get a film.", moments: the editor diff, the same
scene on five canvases, frame 412 rendered twice, `bin/vawe ship`. Kit: `themes/vawe.css`. The vawe
brand is a dark ground `#16151a`, white, the accent `#0a87ff` sparingly, Archivo / Unbounded / JetBrains Mono.
