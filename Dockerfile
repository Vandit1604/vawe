# The workdir is /src, not /repo, on purpose. The deploy host held a BuildKit cache entry for the
# `WORKDIR /repo` layer whose backing overlay directory had been pruned away, so committing ANY child
# layer onto it failed with "failed to stat active key during commit". Renaming the workdir re-keys the
# parent. `docker builder prune -af` on the host is the actual cure.

# The rule this encodes: only COPY a path git actually carries. A COPY of a gitignored directory is a
# hard failure at build time, not a missing file.

# Font binaries are deliberately NOT committed (redistribution), so a clean checkout has none, and
# the social cards (site/app/components/ogCard.tsx) render with them.
# fonts.mjs uses only node builtins, hence no install needed here.
#
# It reads exactly two repo paths: assets/fonts (which it writes) and this lock, which it refuses to
# run without ("Every face would read as unlocked"). The lock moved to harness/media/ in the layout
# pass and no COPY followed it, so the build died here. docker-check reads COPY lines and cannot see
# what a RUN step opens, which is why this one arrived as a failed deploy rather than a failed gate.

# --- the site ---
# The REPO ROOT package.json, because site/lib/schema.ts imports `../../package.json` to read the
# engine's real description, version, licence and repo URL into the SoftwareApplication JSON-LD
# rather than retyping them. From /src/site/lib that resolves to /src/package.json, which was not in
# the image, so the site built clean on every laptop and died here with "Module not found: Can't
# resolve '../../package.json'". The same class as the assets/plinth line below: a path that exists
# in a checkout is not a path that exists in a build context.
#
# Copied at /src, ABOVE the site's own npm ci, so it is a layer that only busts when the engine's
# version or description actually changes. docker-check reads COPY lines and cannot see what a JS
# import resolves to, which is why this arrived as a failed deploy rather than a failed gate.

# `prebuild` runs ../scripts/site/vendor-assets.mjs, which copies the faces into public/assets/
# BUILD TO `.next`, DO NOT RENAME AFTERWARDS. `site/package.json`'s build script pins
# NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build so a running `next dev` and a `next build` do not fight over `.next`
# locally. Nothing runs `next dev` in this image, so the pin has no job here and two attempts to
# accommodate it both shipped broken.
#
# The first attempt left the COPYs naming `.next` while the build wrote `.next-build`: six production
# deploys failed on `failed to calculate checksum of ref ... not found`, on a layer BuildKit had also
# printed as CACHED, which reads exactly like a poisoned cache and is really a path never written.
#
# The second renamed the directory after the build. That deployed GREEN and served every stylesheet as
# a 404, because `next build --output standalone` BAKES the dist dir into its own server:
# `.next-build/standalone/server.js` carries `distDir: "./.next-build"` and the standalone tree nests a
# second `.next-build/` inside itself. Renaming the outer directory moves nothing the server looks for.
#
# So run the prebuild explicitly and then a plain `next build`, which takes the `.next` default from
# next.config.mjs. `npm run build` would re-apply the pin. The guard is what stops a third attempt:
# it names the cause instead of letting the failure arrive as a 404 on a page that returned 200.
# Next bakes rewrites into the build, so the docs origin (site/lib/docs-origin.mjs) must be here at build time.
