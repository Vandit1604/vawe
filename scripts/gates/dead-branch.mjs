// dead-branch.mjs: a branch that can never be taken, or two branches that do the same thing.
//
//   node scripts/gates/dead-branch.mjs      ·   make dead-branch
//
// `deploySuccess` shipped `i === last ? T.green : T.green`. A ternary whose arms are identical, next
// to a condition that was always true. Between them the cascade the block exists for was unreachable,
// and NO render gate could ever catch it: the output was valid, deterministic and wrong-by-omission.
// That is a linter's job, and this repo has one dependency and intends to keep it that way, so this is
// the cheap half done honestly rather than a linter added for one rule (docs/MISTAKES.md #82).
//
// WHAT IT CATCHES:
//   1. SYNTACTIC, `cond ? X : X`, both arms textually identical after normalising space.
//   2. DATAFLOW. A name that is BOUND and then never mentioned again in its own file: a value
//      computed and discarded, a destructured prop read and dropped. Plus a condition whose operands
//      are all constants, so the branch cannot vary.
//
// WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT: the multi-hop case (`const done = i < n-1` … later `done || i === n-1`),
// where the condition is invariant only after propagating a non-constant expression through another
// binding. That needs a real dataflow engine over a real AST; this repo has one dependency and intends
// to keep it. Stated rather than implied, because a gate whose limits are unwritten gets trusted past
// them (docs/MISTAKES.md #82).
//
// THE MEASUREMENT UNDERNEATH RULE 2, stated because a gate's blind spot is never in the rule it
// states: "never mentioned again" is decided by counting word-boundary occurrences of the identifier
// in the WHOLE FILE, raw text included. Comments and strings count as mentions. That is deliberately
// the over-counting direction. A shadowed name in two scopes, a name referenced only from a template
// literal, a name mentioned only in a comment: all count as used, so all are MISSED rather than
// invented. Exactly one occurrence means no scope in the file can possibly read it.

// reported "256 source files" as though that were all of them. core/props.js records the same flaw
// turning into 1482 false findings in a sibling gate; here it produced silence instead, which is
// harder to notice and no better. Now: every tracked .js/.mjs file, minus directories excluded BY
