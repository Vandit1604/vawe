# harness/dev/worktree.sh: make a git worktree usable by an agent, in about a second.
#
#   harness/dev/worktree.sh add <name> [scope-glob ...]  → .claude/worktrees/<name>, ready to run gates
#   harness/dev/worktree.sh rm  <name>
#
# THE SCOPE GLOBS ARE OPTIONAL, and record what harness/author/critics.mjs's DECIDERS already carry
# for deciders: the files this worktree is TOLD it owns, so worktree-status.mjs can show who owns what,
# and a second worktree started with an overlapping scope is warned (never blocked) at creation time.
# See harness/lib/worktree-claims.mjs. Leaving them off costs nothing beyond today's status quo.
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `git worktree add` checks out tracked files only. This repo keeps 444M of
# node_modules, an 11M bin/, and 108 of its 149 scenes out of git, so a bare worktree cannot run a
# single gate, and fails QUIETLY: `layer-props` walks 41 scenes instead of 149 and prints a green tick.
# Measured: the worktree itself takes 0.70s and 127M. The naive fix, two npm installs, takes minutes and
# is why people abandon worktrees (towardsdatascience.com/ai-agents-need-their-own-desk...).
#
# WHAT IS SHARED AND WHAT IS COPIED, because the distinction is the whole design:
#   node_modules  SYMLINK, read-only in practice. pnpm's own guidance warns against a shared store for
#                 mutually untrusted agents, and the corruption case is CONCURRENT INSTALLS, so no
#                 agent may run npm install in a worktree. If you need to, make a real checkout.
#   scenes        COPIED. Two agents editing one scene through a symlink is the shared-tree collision
#                 this whole mechanism exists to prevent.
#   bin/vawe      SYMLINK. Built once, read many.

# This loop used to be its own hand-written list: assets/fonts/local, films/scene/*.json, and each
# brand's components/scenes/photos. `.worktreeinclude` meanwhile asked for `assets/fonts/*.woff2`,
# `assets/brands/**` and `assets/cutouts/**` as well, with a comment on each explaining which silent
# failure it prevents. The script did not implement its own manifest, so every worktree made here was
# missing the vendored webfonts and every brand IMAGE. Measured: `snap-scenes` in a fresh worktree gave
# 16 identical · 61 changed · 29 errored against main's 106 identical, every one of those from a
# fallback font or an image that was never there, and none of them a real defect.
#
# That is engine-doctrine/MISTAKES.md #450 in another costume: a hand-kept scope drifting from the vocabulary it
# claims to cover. A manifest with two implementations has no implementation.
#
# THE COPY ITSELF IS NOW `sync-worktree.mjs`, not a second copy loop. Main can keep moving after this
# worktree is created (an owner edits a film while an agent's worktree sits open for hours), and
# nothing here would notice; `sync-worktree.mjs` is the one place that both makes the first copy and
# can safely re-run later to catch a worktree up, because it is the one place that keeps the
# hash manifest a re-run needs to tell "main moved on" from "I edited this" apart.

# handed a worktree with no library and had to copy it in by hand. The new worktree is checked out at
