// The ship gate on a fresh review: a final render needs, for the page as it is now, either a `vawe judge --fresh` verdict (it starts its
// own headless session, so it cannot be the author) or a `vawe critique` run in a session other than the one that rendered the draft.
// Both log the page digest (judgeEvent and verbEvent pageHash); this reads it back.
// Why a gate: traces of 44 film agents showed 21 of 23 shipped past the warnings and 2 of 23 ran a critique first.
