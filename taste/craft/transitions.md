A transition is the seam between two beats. It is grammar, not decoration: it means something, and the
meaning must be chosen, not defaulted. The failure this page exists to stop is picking one effect (a
blur, a dissolve) and spraying it on every cut. That is not "smooth". It is a seam that says nothing,
ten times. [selection.md](selection.md) lists intent to choice in one line each. This is the deep dive for the cut.

## The prime rule

> A transition must serve the relationship between the two beats and the feeling across the seam. If it
> serves neither, it is a hard cut.

The hard cut is the default and the great majority of professional edits
([hard-cut-default](../rules/hard-cut-default.md)). You earn anything more by naming what it does
([seam-meaning](../rules/seam-meaning.md)). "It looks smoother" is not a reason. It is the blur-spam tell. Crossfade means
"this continues". Hard cut means "wake up" or disruption. Slow dissolve means "drift with me". You
crossfade everything: use hard cuts for disruption and register shifts.

## Emotion first: Walter Murch's Rule of Six

Murch (*In the Blink of an Eye*) ranks what a cut serves, by weight:

| # | criterion | weight | asks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | emotion | 51% | does the cut serve what the audience should feel? |
| 2 | story | 23% | does it advance the narrative? |
| 3 | rhythm | 10% | is it the right moment, musically? |
| 4 | eye-trace | 7% | does it respect where the viewer already looks? |
| 5 | 2D plane, screen direction | 5% | does it honour the 180 degree axis? |
| 6 | 3D spatial continuity | 4% | is the physical space consistent? |

Emotion outranks the other five combined. Never give up emotion for story, story for rhythm, and so on
down. A cut that breaks screen direction and nails the feeling is correct. Cut where the audience would
blink: on the completed idea, not mid-thought. That is why a typed line finishes before the seam and a
beat lands before it leaves.

## Invisible or expressive

Continuity (Hollywood): the cut is invisible. Match on action, motivated cuts, J and L cuts, a
shared-element morph. Most seams live here. Montage (Eisenstein): the cut is shown, because meaning is
made in the collision (the Kuleshov effect: the same face reads as hunger or grief by what it is cut
against). Dissolve, graphic match, smash cut. Ask: should this seam disappear or speak?

## The taxonomy: type, meaning, when

| transition | signifies | reach for it when | in a page |
|---|---|---|---|
| hard cut | nothing, invisible | the default; two beats are one thought | back-to-back beats; overlap a few frames so the stage never empties |
| cross-dissolve | time passing, a link, gentleness | soften, link two images | opacity blend of both beats |
| fade to black | an ending, an act break | open or close the film or a major section | fade to the ground, a real pause; earn it |
| wipe | playful, deliberate, shows the seam | an energetic change of place or time | `clip-path` mask, a soft edge (feather) |
| iris | focus, vintage, isolate | spotlight one thing | circular `clip-path` |
| match cut, graphic | "these two are the same" | bridge scenes by a visual rhyme | same framing or shape across a hard cut |
| match cut, on action | seamless, energy carried | cut on a movement so the eye rides it past the seam | a shape on one path across both scenes (`prompts/moves/cut-on-motion.md`) |
| match cut, conceptual | wit | a word in A pays off in B | copy and timing across a hard cut |
| smash cut | shock, jolt | end on maximum tonal contrast | hard cut plus a hard content or ground contrast |
| whip pan | frantic energy, "meanwhile" | a kinetic change; hide the cut in blur | fast translate with directional blur on both beats |
| push, slide | a new place, same energy | carry the eye one way | translate both beats together, one direction per seam |
| zoom, punch | product focus, a calm reveal | push into a detail | scale up through the cut |
| squeeze | a fast pivot | a speed ramp you can see | smear-stretch through the cut |
| J-cut | anticipation | lead into what is coming | next beat's audio starts before its picture ([sound.md](sound.md)) |
| L-cut | a held emotion | hold a tone while the image moves on | audio runs over the next entrance |
| shared-element morph | magic, same identity | a thing becomes its next role (highest craft) | one persistent element repositions and resizes across the cut |
| camera travel | one world, beats are places | the content has a spatial logic worth walking | the transition is the flight; no cut (below) |
| jump cut | urgency, restlessness | compress time on purpose | hard cut in the same framing; sparingly |

## The decision procedure: run it at every seam

1. Does this seam need to exist? If two beats flow as one thought, use the invisible default: hard cut,
   match on action, or a shared-element morph. Most seams stop here.
2. What must the viewer feel across it? Continuity is a cut. Time or gentleness is a dissolve. Closure
   is a fade. Shock is a smash. Anticipation is a J-cut. Lingering is an L-cut.
3. Invisible or expressive?
4. What is the relationship? Same object, new state: morph. Same action: match on action. Rhyme: match
   cut. Time: dissolve. Act boundary: fade. Tonal opposition: smash. New place with energy: whip or wipe.
5. What does the seam mean? A change of time, place or perspective justifies a visible transition.
   Nothing to signify: cut.
6. Lead or linger with sound? This is where "smooth" comes from in pro work.
7. Eye-trace and velocity: cut where the eye already is. Keep direction and speed across the seam (exit
   accelerating, enter decelerating through a shared blur).
8. Rhythm: accelerate into a climax, then hold the payoff. Cut on the beat when the user gave a track, or
   two frames early.
9. Restraint check: is this the one primary family or one of the earned accents
   ([hard-cut-default](../rules/hard-cut-default.md))? Adjacent moving transitions change axis or direction
   ([seam-variety](../rules/seam-variety.md)): two back-to-back seams that both push left read as a stutter.

If a seam cannot answer 1 to 5 with a real relationship or feeling, it is a hard cut. That rule stops
effect-spam in both directions, monotone and soup.

## Restraint: the invisible cut dominates

Straight cuts are the meat. Dissolves, fades and wipes are seasoning. You can cut a whole film with
hard cuts. A different showy transition on every seam is the amateur tell. Pick one primary family.
Save the boldest accent for the payoff. Make the outro the simplest. Blur was not wrong as
a primary: it was wrong as the only thing, with no earned accents. Transition only to mark a change of
time, place or perspective.

## Speed is the anti-repetition lever

The transition is the verb and the timing is the adverb. A seam with no speed profile reads flat, and a
film whose seams all ride one gentle curve feels repetitive however many effects it uses. Vary the
velocity across the film, not only the effect.

| profile | curve | reach for it on |
|---|---|---|
| ramp | slow, fast, slow | whips, zooms, squeezes, any thrown seam (the default for motion) |
| rush | EASE.launch, accelerate away | an exit: the beat leaves faster than it arrived |
| brake | EASE.land, decelerate in | an entrance: the beat arrives slower than it set off |
| pop, spring | EASE.pop: overshoot then settle | a chip, badge or UI element landing (rare; the page names it) |
| snappy | decisive, no overshoot | a punchy cut that lands and stops |
| smooth | EASE.glide, gentle at both ends | a calm dissolve or fade, where a ramp would fight the mood |
| linear | constant speed | a deliberately mechanical sweep; rarely what you want |

In a page, write a ramp with an `EASE` name (`core/motion/presets.js`: `carry` into a cut, `land` out of it), or a
`[[f, v]]` table in `seek(t)`. A whole film gets one velocity personality: calm decelerates in, a branded
film uses ramps, hype is snappy, tense rushes. An explicit curve on one seam still wins.

## Durations

The ranges per transition type (match overlap, whip, dissolve, slide, zoom, fade) are in
[seam-timing](../rules/seam-timing.md), in seconds. Finals render at 60 fps, so count frames at 60.
A seam is felt, not measured: round to the frame. A whip that is not fast and blurred reads as a slow
slide. Soft edges are the cheap-versus-polished tell: a hard wipe edge reads as a slide deck, a feathered
one reads graded. A wipe can sweep at any angle, not only the four cardinals.

## Where the eye is at a cut

Nothing measures this: judge it by eye on the frames on both sides of a cut (`bin/vawe critique`). Read the focal point of the frame before the cut and put the incoming subject at or near that screen point; do not make the eye cross the frame at a joint (Derek Lieu). Murch ranks eye-trace fourth of six, at 7 %, under emotion (51 %), story (23 %) and rhythm (10 %), so a cut that serves the story may cost the eye a journey. It is a strong default, not a wall. Rule: [eye-trace](../rules/eye-trace.md).

The eye ranks targets in a fixed order: brighter, larger, in focus, moving (a built frame has no face). The focal point is the winner among the live elements, not what you meant it to be. Brighter means contrast against the ground, not luminance: white type on a white field is the brightest thing and nobody looks at it.

The eye is steered, not only ranked, and all four terms can be animated: brighter (a glow whose intensity, radius and colour change over the shot, cold to hot, wide to tight), larger (travel in Z under perspective instead of scaling, so the element stays crisp), in focus (rack the blur from one plane to another), moving (a keyed path, or a beam that sweeps and reveals what it touches through a moving `mask-image`). Light the subject, then move the light: a glow parked on the hero stops being seen within a second. Rack, do not cut, when two things share a frame and the second matters now. Ask of every beat: where is the eye at the start, where should it be at the end, and what moves it? "It stays where the cut put it" is fair on a held beat and a failure on any other.

When a cut makes the eye jump, in order of cost: place the next headline where the last focal point was (free in a built film); aim the outgoing beat at the corner the next beat opens in; give the next beat more time (a run of short beats, each demanding a jump, never lets the viewer catch up); keep the jump and say why in the page's `authoring` block. No source publishes a distance: the rule's 0.30 of the frame diagonal is this repo's working figure.

## Align the beats to the seam

A blend seam mixes the frame just before the cut with the frame just after. If both beats are on screen
across the cut (the outgoing text never left, the incoming text already arrived), the seam crossfades two
nearly identical stages and the copy mushes into an unreadable double. The outgoing beat must end at
the seam, and the incoming beat must start at it. A persistent morph element is the exception and should
span the cut. Check with the eye: `bin/vawe critique` reads the loop seam and measured deltas.

The frame must not go empty across a joint either. A one-frame luminance dip is a flash. Several frames
of emptiness mean the outgoing beat left before the incoming one arrived. A blank frame on a white
ground never dips, it only drains, so look at the frames, not only the luminance.

A full-bleed layer above a moving layer must not start mid-move and hide it before it plays: that reads
as a hard cut nobody authored. Start the cover after the move ends, or raise the mover.

## Station to station: the launch-film transition with no cut

The Apple move: instead of cutting between product shots, the camera flies through one continuous space
and dwells on each feature in turn. There is no seam because there is no cut. The film reads as one
world, not a stack of slides. Reach for it when the beats are places with a spatial logic (a dashboard,
then a panel inside it, then a detail), not unrelated claims. Each station has a point to centre, a
zoom, a flight time into it and a dwell. Use constant speed on interior legs: an eased curve at each stop
zeroes velocity and breaks one flight into N hops ([camera-path-linear](../rules/camera-path-linear.md)).

## The motion-design layer (elements, not shots)

- Shared element (container transform) is match on action. A headline shrinks into a label. A card slides
  to its next mark. It is the highest-craft continuity we have.
- Easing by role: an entrance lands (EASE.land), an exit launches (EASE.launch), a move or morph between
  seen positions travels (EASE.carry), constant motion is linear. Springs suit interruptible motion because
  they keep velocity. App UI timing budgets do not transfer to film ([motion-craft.md](motion-craft.md#which-ui-motion-standards-transfer)).
- Diegetic beats non-diegetic. Motion that emerges from a real trigger (a whip, a touch point, a shared
  element) reads honest. A generic fade laid on top reads as stock. Prefer the transition that arises
  from the content.
- Choreography (Material): one focal point, share only the most important element across the seam, one
  directional path, stagger secondary entrances, never fire a group at once ([stagger](../rules/stagger.md)).
