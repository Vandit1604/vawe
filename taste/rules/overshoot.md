id: overshoot
step: motion
principle: Overshoot is a claim about mass. Type, UI and a counting number do not overshoot by default, and a number never passes its final figure. Some arrivals of things with mass land with a spring, so a film where none do reads stiff.
limit: 21 to 61 percent of the arrivals that move overshoot; a count never passes its final figure
range: reference films overshoot 21 to 41 percent of their arrivals (p10 to p90); EASE.pop (about 15 percent) only where the move is a press or a pop, named in the page, and only on things that then hold still; roll-up 0.8 to 1.4 s, the last 30 percent of the time covers the last 5 percent of the count
break-when: the brief asks for a playful register (the one reference profile where overshoot is right is a playful consumer app), or one deliberate stiff register (a terminal, a ticker) the brief names
instead: arrive fast, land soft: EASE.land, or approach(k 0.12 to 0.19). Give about 1 in 3 arrivals a spring: EASE.pop, or curveToLinear(CURVES.overshoot) from core/motion/springs.js. Never on text held for reading (it wobbles). Ease a count with expo-out or quart-out: the deceleration is the weight; counting to a small number is a stunt, cut it.
check: judge, overshoot-share
judge: Does any word, UI element or count overshoot with no stated reason? Does any count pass its final figure and fall back? Does any arrival settle past its rest position and return, or do none?
prevents: measured over 22 reference films (harness/dev/bar-from-refs.mjs): they overshoot 21 to 41 percent of arrivals, our films 0 to 11 percent. doc banned-defaults: a big bounce on every word reads as a children's app. A film that says 1,822 and paints 1,900 on the way breaks the rule to use real figures.

## Example

Of nine card arrivals, three use EASE.pop and six use EASE.land. A "Send" button presses with EASE.pop; the headline lands on EASE.land; 0 to 1,822 runs over 1.1 s on an expo-out.

Draft check, overshoot-share: The draft check reads the easing of each element's entering moves from its animations (a fade alone cannot overshoot, and a curve it cannot read is not counted). A page that paints in window.seek has no animations to read: its arrivals are read from element boxes (a move that starts faded out and ends faded in, past its end by 3 percent of its length or 1 px). It needs 6 arrivals. Under the range or over 61 percent (1.5 times the reference p90) it gives advice.
