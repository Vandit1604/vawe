id: world-turns
step: look
principle: The world (ground, palette, composition) turns at least every 2 s or at each beat, whichever comes first. Tone changes per beat; the backdrop is always a decision, never a default.
limit: at most 8 near-identical tiles in a row on the 5 fps sheet, at most 4 at the tail; no data-world element visible longer than 2 s (longer when its text needs it to read, at most the readable-hold ceiling of 5 s plus 0.8 s); adjacent worlds with the same ground and the same words are one world
range: a new element, a cut or a ground swap every 1 to 2 s
break-when: a declared hold (world-held@a-b, tile-run@a-b waiver with a reason) for a held wordmark or a camera-travel film whose subject never stops moving
instead: start a new data-world with a new ground, object and words at least every 2 s; a held 7 s world needs cuts near 2 s (taste/craft/film-structure.md). Change the ground at a cut the film already has; carry the change across the join (a colour that follows the content), never a cold flash. Judge a moving backdrop at 4 or more timestamps, never one still. A ruled grid is a design tool's canvas: use it only if you can say what it does in one clause.
check: world-held
judge: The turns are the page's data-world spans, a new world is a turn even on the same ground. Count identical adjacent tiles on the sheet. Does each world last 2 s or less?
prevents: feedback: "the world should turn every 1-2 beats; 7 beats on one colour field are events, not scenes". vawe-sting: cobalt held 2.3 to 5.0 s. judge1: static 1.1 s tail. judge2: 1.4 s static lockup. ref: ground inverts at 5.5, 7.7, 19.3, 21.3 s; a new word cuts in every 0.5 to 1.5 s. 82 percent of 135 library scenes painted one backdrop for the whole runtime.

print-storyboard: turn the world every 1 to 2 s (a new element, a cut, a ground swap), not one lockup held

## Example

Right: cobalt ground to paper ground at 1.8 s, a new word at 2.6 s. Wrong: one colour field with one lockup from 2.3 s to 5.0 s.
