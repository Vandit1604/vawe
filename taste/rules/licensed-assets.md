id: licensed-assets
step: look
principle: Embed only assets you may publish. Music is the asset class with automated enforcement.
limit: never embed copyrighted posters, album covers, film stills, news photos, paid stock without a licence or copyrighted music
range: safe: CC0, public domain, your own assets, brand logos used nominatively, CC BY with the credit kept; never CC ND; CC NC is unsafe for client or paid work
break-when: never
instead: capture the real product UI. Check a new source against engine-doctrine/ASSET-SOURCES.md. Record the source and licence of every bed in assets/music/credits.json before it goes under a film.
check: none
judge: Is any image or track one we may not publish?
prevents: doc IMAGERY.md and SOUND.md: a wrong track gets a Content ID claim on upload; syncing music to moving image is always Adapted Material, so no ND track can go in any film.
