// quality/gates/doc-refs.mjs · every command and every file path the docs NAME must exist.
//
//   node quality/gates/doc-refs.mjs      ·   make doc-refs
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: docs are read as instructions. A wrong instruction is worse than a missing one,
// because an author trusts it, types it, gets "No rule to make target", and learns to distrust the
// whole file. CLAUDE.md alone names ~40 make targets and ~60 repo paths, all hand-typed, all
// describing a Makefile and a tree that move under them. `craft-coverage`/`doc-map` already resolve
// markdown links to `.md` files. Nothing checked a single `make …` command, a backticked source path
// (`core/layout/safe.js`), a skill directory, or a link to a non-markdown file. This does.
//
// SCAN SURFACE IS DISCOVERED, NEVER LISTED. `git ls-files '*.md'` minus a few directories excluded
// BY REASON below. A gate whose surface is a hardcoded array is a map of where the docs lived the day
// it was written (core/props.js records how that same flaw produced 1482 false findings elsewhere).
//
// THE MEASUREMENT, stated because a gate's blind spot is never in the rule it states:
//   * Only text inside a code span (`…`) or a fenced code block is read for `make <target>`. English
//     prose contains "make sure", "make it good", "make a video"; none of those are commands, and a
//     gate that reported them would be skimmed and would take its real findings with it. The cost is
//     stated plainly: an un-backticked command citation is MISSED, not invented. Docs here backtick
//     their commands, so the miss is small and the direction is the safe one.
//   * A path is a candidate only when it contains `/` and either ends in a known extension or ends
//     in `/`. Placeholders (`<topic>`, `${x}`, `…`) are skipped, never guessed at.
//   * A path resolves if GIT TRACKS it relative to the repo root OR relative to the citing doc. Both
//     conventions are in use here, and a gate may not pick a favourite. Tracked, not merely present on
//     disk: a path can exist on the author's machine, gitignored or simply never `git add`ed, and pass
//     here while a fresh clone has nothing at that path. Comparing exact git-stored strings also makes
//     this case-sensitive, where a filesystem check quietly was not.
//   * A cited path that git does not track ON PURPOSE (a generated artefact, a gitignored brand asset)
//     is not a failure: it is looked up in `KNOWN_UNTRACKED`, a short list that costs a reason per
//     entry, and printed as known-untracked instead. Nothing else lets a doc opt out of this check.
// Pure: reads files and the Makefile, and runs `git ls-files` (read-only). No render, no network.
