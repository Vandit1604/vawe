// quality/gates/site-build-check.mjs: run the site's REAL build steps locally before they can fail
// silently on the deploy host.
//
//   node quality/gates/site-build-check.mjs [range]     ·   make deploy-check
//
// WHY. vawe.dev was dead for ten days (2026-09-06 to 2026-09-16) behind three stacked breaks, and every
// one would have shown up the moment someone ran the site's own build commands:
//   1. `COPY assets/plinth ./assets/plinth` copied a directory a commit had untracked. Caught today by
//      `make docker-check` (quality/gates/docker-context-check.mjs), which reads COPY lines against git.
//   2. `generators/media/fonts.mjs` needs `harness/media/fonts.lock.json`; a rename moved the lock and
//      no COPY followed it. docker-check only understands COPY sources, not what a RUN step opens, so
//      this slipped past it. The fix here is not a smarter parser, it is running the same command the
//      Dockerfile runs: `node generators/media/fonts.mjs` fails immediately, and loudly, without the lock.
//   3. `next build` runs `tsc`, and a page under site/app had a type error that two review passes wrote
//      off as pre-existing. `next build` was never actually run locally, so nothing ever disagreed.
// Nobody noticed because the OLD container kept serving: the push succeeded, the deploy died quietly
// after. `make docker-check` already catches (1) and would have caught (2) had it understood RUN
// inputs; this file closes the remaining gap by running the real commands instead of parsing them.
//
// WHAT RUNS, AND WHY EACH ONE MADE THE CUT:
//   - scripts/site/site-engine.mjs   the site's own `prebuild`. Vendors the engine into site/public and
//                                    REFUSES on a missing asset (engine-doctrine class of break 1). ~0.5s.
//   - generators/media/fonts.mjs     the exact command the Dockerfile RUNs after the lock COPY. Skips
//                                    files already on disk, so a repeat run is near-instant (~0.05s
//                                    measured here); it is the lock file's existence and hash match that
//                                    make it fail, which is exactly what broke in incident 2.
//   - `tsc --noEmit` in site/        the type-check half of `next build`, measured at ~7s here against
//                                    ~31s for the full `next build` on this machine (and CI reports the
//                                    full build runs to several minutes). It reproduces incident 3's
//                                    exact failure category for a fraction of the cost. A full `next
//                                    build` would also re-verify bundling and static generation, which
//                                    have not been the failure mode twice, so it is not run here; if that
//                                    changes, this is the line to change.
//
// WHEN IT RUNS AT ALL. A push that touches nothing the site build reads (a film JSON, a doc, an
// unrelated gate) pays nothing. The trigger set is DERIVED from the Dockerfile's own COPY lines (up to
// the docs-site stage, which this file does not build) rather than hand-typed, so it cannot drift the
// way a maintained list would.
//
// HOW IT DEGRADES. `site/node_modules` will not exist in a fresh clone or a freshly created worktree,
// and this check cannot run `tsc` (or trust `site-engine.mjs`'s d3 resolution) without it. It refuses
// to pass silently: it prints that it was SKIPPED and names the fix (`npm ci` in site/), and exits 0,
// because a missing local install is an environment gap, not a code defect this push introduced.
