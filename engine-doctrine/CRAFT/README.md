# CRAFT: engine and process guides

Taste and motion rules moved to `taste/` at the repo root. Start at `taste/README.md`: one rule per file,
the first read in `taste/build/DIGEST.md`, the long reasons in `taste/craft/`. The guides left here are
about how to run a film or change the engine, not about how a film should look.

| Guide | Load it when you are... | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| [ROUTING.md](ROUTING.md) | "let's make a video", before opening any file | the film-type table (nine types, first matching row wins), the `prompts/` template and skill each one takes, and how to resolve common ambiguities |
| [PITCH.md](PITCH.md) | the brief is unformed, "make a video about X" with no locked angle yet | diverge before you converge: five concepts sampled wide, an anti-median probability gate, a silhouette check, the three-line pitch format, and what got rejected late |
| [REFERENCE-STUDY.md](REFERENCE-STUDY.md) | a real video looks better than ours and you want to learn and copy why, or you recreate a reference or reflect a site | how to sample a reference, the premium habits, the recreation loop, reflecting a site, the honest 1:1 ceiling |
| [SUBAGENTS.md](SUBAGENTS.md) | about to fan work out to subagents | what a fan-out costs; the brief lines and worktree contract every subagent brief needs (the critics: `skills/vawe-critique`) |
| [ENGINE-CHANGES.md](ENGINE-CHANGES.md) | you are changing the ENGINE rather than authoring a film, or writing a command that reports something | why a gate is the last resort, why sugar must fail loudly, the three extension primitives, how to price a change that touches the capture path, the framework harvest, the one output contract of a reporting command |
| [WRITING-FOR-AGENTS.md](WRITING-FOR-AGENTS.md) | you are writing AGENTS.md, a SKILL.md, or a brief an agent will read | six patterns that keep a rule readable by an agent, and the SKILL.md frontmatter and size contract |

## How these relate to the rest of the docs

- `taste/` = what a film should look and sound like: the rules, and the reasons behind them.
- `engine-doctrine/CRAFT/` = how to choose a film type, run the loop and change the engine (you are here).
- `prompts/moves/README.md` = what techniques exist; `core/motion/README.md` = the motion numbers.
- `skills/{taste-skill,impeccable}` = enforcement for web UI work, not for films.
