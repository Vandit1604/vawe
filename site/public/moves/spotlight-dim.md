# Spotlight dim

**Use when** a screen with several parts is on and one of them is the point. A rounded hole starts
as the whole frame and closes onto the target; its own `box-shadow` is the dim, so everything
outside the hole falls to 20 percent and the target is the only thing lit. The target leans in 4
percent on the same curve. Clip: [spotlight-dim.mp4](spotlight-dim.mp4).
Demo: [demo/spotlight-dim.html](demo/spotlight-dim.html).

```css
.hole { position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100vw; height: 100vh; border-radius: 0;
        box-shadow: 0 0 0 100vmax rgba(10, 9, 13, 0.8); pointer-events: none; }
```

```js
import { curveToLinear, CURVES } from '../../core/motion/springs.js';
const settle = curveToLinear(CURVES.expoOut);
const pad = '0.6vh';
hole.animate([
  { left: '0px', top: '0px', width: '100vw', height: '100vh', borderRadius: '0px' },
  { left: `calc(14vw - ${pad})`, top: `calc(52vh - ${pad})`, width: `calc(35vw + 2 * ${pad})`, height: `calc(34vh + 2 * ${pad})`, borderRadius: '3.6vh' }],
  { duration: 800, delay: 150, easing: settle, fill: 'both' });
target.animate([{ scale: 1 }, { scale: 1.04 }], { duration: 800, delay: 150, easing: settle, fill: 'both' });
```

Sound: none; the dim points the eye without a sound.

The hole closes from the whole frame, so the dim arrives as the light narrows and never fades in as
a flat veil. Match the hole radius to the target radius plus its padding (3 vh + 0.6 vh here) or a
lit corner shows. Keep the dim at 0.75 to 0.85: lower and the rest still competes, higher and the
context is lost. A padding over 1.5 vh reads as a frame border, which is banned. Use `calc()` with
literal lengths in the keyframes; `var()` in a keyframe does not interpolate.

Looks (ground, type, radius, accent) live in `demo/demo.css`; this snippet keeps neutral tokens.
