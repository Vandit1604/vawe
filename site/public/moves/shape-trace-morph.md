# Shape trace morph

**Use when** a brand mark should be built like an After Effects shape layer: a thin outline draws on
(trim paths) as an object the brand is about, here a delivery route, then the line morphs into the real mark on one spring and the name lands.
Clip: [shape-trace-morph.mp4](shape-trace-morph.mp4). Demo:
[demo/shape-trace-morph.html](demo/shape-trace-morph.html).

Use once per film, as the brand reveal. For a mark that is a line only, use [mark-trace.md](mark-trace.md).

Sound: droplet at 1.05 s, when the route starts to morph (default gain).

- The story: the stroke draws the thing the brand is about (Relay moves work from stop to stop, so the
  stroke is a route with a dot at each stop), and the route becomes the Relay mark. The second chevron
  slides out of the first: one hand-off, the relay. Pick an object that belongs to your brand; do not
  reuse a generic hexagon.
- Both paths need the same command count, in the same order (here `M`, five `L`, `Z`). The browser
  interpolates command by command; a different count or type snaps at the first frame instead of morphing.
  The route and the chevron both have 1 M, 5 L and 1 Z. A mark made of several shapes morphs the first
  shape only and brings the others in after it (`twin`).
- `pathLength="1"` with `stroke-dasharray: 1 2` makes one offset value trim any shape. Stop the trace
  at the closing segment (`RETURN`) so the route reads as an open line, and take the offset to 0 in the
  morph so the closed mark has a full outline.
- Order in time: trace 0.1 to 1.0 s on a smoothstep, morph from 1.05 s on the spring with the fill, the
  second chevron from 1.65 s, the name from 2.05 s. Use `fill: 'forwards'` on the morph so its first
  frame does not override the trace.
- Pair the points by position: the start of the route should become the start of the chevron, or the
  morph twists. Add the name after the spring has landed, never during it.

Looks (ground, type, radius, accent) live in `demo/demo.css`; this snippet keeps neutral tokens.
