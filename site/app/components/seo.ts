// ONE HELPER, NOT 27 COPIES. Every route on vawe.dev calls this instead of hand-rolling its own
// canonical/OpenGraph/Twitter block. `metadataBase` (app/layout.tsx) is set to https://vawe.dev, so a
// relative `path` here resolves correctly for both the canonical link and the OG url.
//
// No `images` field here on purpose: every route this helper serves has a sibling
// `opengraph-image.tsx` (see app/components/ogCard.tsx) that Next reads and injects the og:image /
// twitter:image tags from automatically. Setting an image here too would just print a second,
// competing tag. A main page with a share loop (public/og/<route>.mp4, scripts/site/og-cards.mjs --loops) also
// gets og:video. Only the homepage and routes that set no openGraph take the root `app/opengraph-image.tsx`; a route built with this helper needs its own card. The homepage sets
// its own openGraph/twitter block directly in app/layout.tsx instead of calling this helper.
