            <p>
              A Vawe film is one HTML page: CSS, Web Animations, SVG, canvas or three.js. An agent
              already writes all of that, so it learns no private format and guesses no schema. If
              something it would naturally write fails, that is a bug in the engine.

                <code>critique</code> lays out the frames to look at, and <code>ship</code> renders
                the final at 60fps with motion blur and audio. A wrong flag exits with the list of
                valid ones, so an agent corrects itself in one step instead of reading source.
