You want one video per row of data: one clip per user, product or post. This post shows how to batch render videos from one HTML template with a short Node script. We ran it for three rows and give the real times and sizes.

vawe has no template feature. It has no `--data` flag, no `--var` flag and no query string for a page. A film is one `page.html` file, and `bin/vawe dev` renders that file. So the pattern is yours: write one page file per row, then render each file.

## The pattern

Keep the data in a JSON block inside the page. A small script reads the block and fills the text and the colour. Then a Node loop copies the template, swaps the JSON block for one row, and renders the copy.

The template is `template.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<meta name="duration" content="3">
<style>
  :root { --bg: #0b0d12; --accent: #4f7cff; }
  body { margin: 0; background: var(--bg); color: #f4f6fb; font: 700 calc(var(--vh) * 0.09) system-ui; }
  .card { position: absolute; inset: 0; display: grid; place-content: center; padding: 0 8%; }
  h1 { margin: 0; animation: rise 0.6s var(--ease-land) both 0.3s; }
  p { margin: 0.3em 0 0; font-size: 0.5em; color: var(--accent); animation: rise 0.6s var(--ease-land) both 0.6s; }
  @keyframes rise { from { transform: translateY(calc(var(--vh) * 0.04)); opacity: 0 } to { transform: none; opacity: 1 } }
</style>
<script type="application/json" id="data">{"title":"Hello","line":"First variant","accent":"#4f7cff"}</script>
<div class="card" data-world="title"><h1 id="t"></h1><p id="l"></p></div>
<script>
  const d = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('data').textContent);
  document.getElementById('t').textContent = d.title;
  document.getElementById('l').textContent = d.line;
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--accent', d.accent);
</script>
```

The data is `rows.json`:

```json
[
 {"id":"ada","data":{"title":"Ada Lovelace","line":"Joined 2026-01","accent":"#4f7cff"}},
 {"id":"grace","data":{"title":"Grace Hopper","line":"Joined 2026-03","accent":"#ff7a59"}},
 {"id":"alan","data":{"title":"Alan Turing","line":"Joined 2026-06","accent":"#3ecf8e"}}
]
```

The loop is `batch.mjs`. Put the three files in the vawe repo root and run it there:

```js
import fs from "node:fs";
import { execFileSync } from "node:child_process";

const rows = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("rows.json", "utf8"));
const template = fs.readFileSync("template.html", "utf8");

for (const row of rows) {
  const dir = `films/batch-${row.id}`;
  fs.mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true });
  const page = template.replace(
    /(<script type="application\/json" id="data">).*?(<\/script>)/s,
    `$1${JSON.stringify(row.data)}$2`,
  );
  fs.writeFileSync(`${dir}/page.html`, page);
  const t0 = Date.now();
  execFileSync("bin/vawe", ["dev", `${dir}/page.html`, "--no-judge", "--fast", "--out", `out/batch-${row.id}.mp4`], { stdio: "inherit" });
  console.log(`${row.id}: ${((Date.now() - t0) / 1000).toFixed(1)} s, ${fs.statSync(`out/batch-${row.id}.mp4`).size} bytes`);
}
```

The page reads only the JSON block. It reads no clock and no random value, so each file renders the same way as any other vawe page. The rules are in [the page contract](/blog/page-contract).

## What we saw

We ran `node batch.mjs` with the three rows. Each draft is 90 frames at 30 fps, 960 by 540 pixels, 3.0 seconds. The times are the wall time of one `bin/vawe dev` call, from the loop.

| Row | Wall time | File size |
|---|---|---|
| ada | 5.6 s | 138,537 bytes |
| grace | 5.9 s | 143,522 bytes |
| alan | 5.3 s | 108,319 bytes |

The three rows took 16.8 seconds together. The loop is serial: one render at a time. The drafts have no sound. This is the clip for the row `grace`:

<video controls muted playsinline poster="/blog/batch-render-videos/grace.webp" src="/blog/batch-render-videos/grace.mp4" width="960"></video>

A draft is half size. For a full-size file, call `bin/vawe ship` instead of `bin/vawe dev`. That command needs an approved draft first. See the [CLI docs](/docs/cli).

## Render more than one clip at a time

vawe limits renders for the whole machine. The default is 2 render slots, and `VAWE_RENDER_SLOTS` changes it (`harness/lib/render-slots.mjs`). A third render waits and prints one line that names the render that holds a slot. Start two loops on halves of your rows to use both slots. More slots than your memory allows will slow every render.

We did not run a parallel batch, so we give no speed-up number.

## What vawe checks on each page

`bin/vawe dev` also prints advice for each page. Our three test pages got advice such as "no brief.md next to the page" and "world held 3 s". The advice does not stop the render. For a batch, write one `brief.md` next to the template, or ignore the advice lines.

## FAQ

**Does vawe have a template or data feature?**
No. A film is one HTML file, and the command has no flag to fill it with data. Use the JSON block pattern above, or any template tool that writes an HTML file.

**Can I pass data in a URL query string?**
We did not test it. The `bin/vawe` verbs take a file path, so the JSON block in the file is the path we ran.

**Can I use Puppeteer instead of `bin/vawe`?**
Yes, if you drive the page clock yourself. [Render HTML to MP4 with headless Chrome](/blog/render-html-to-mp4) shows a 20-line script.

**How long does one clip take?**
Our three 3-second drafts took 5.3 to 5.9 seconds each on one machine. Time grows with length and frame size.
