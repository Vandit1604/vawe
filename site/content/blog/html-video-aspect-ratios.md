You can lay out one HTML page so it renders as 16:9, 9:16 or 1:1 video. The renderer sets two CSS lengths, `--vw` and `--vh`, and an attribute on the root element. You write the layout once and add a rule for each ratio that needs one.

Plain HTML has the same problem as a website on a phone: a layout made for one shape breaks in another. A crop hides content. So vawe never crops. It renders the page again at the new size.

A note on scope: the vawe film pipeline delivers 16:9. The other ratios are a property of the framework, and the page contract keeps your layout ready for them. This post shows that they render. It does not promise vertical delivery.

## What the renderer gives your page

The renderer sets three things before your scripts run.

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `<html data-aspect>` | the ratio being rendered, such as `16:9` |
| `--vw` and `--vh` on `:root` | the frame width and height, as pixel lengths |
| `window.vawe` | an object with `aspect`, `width`, `height` and `fps` |

Use them in CSS. `--vh` holds a unit, for example `1080px`. Write `calc(var(--vh) * 0.09)`, never `* 0.09px`. The full list is in the [aspect ratios docs](/docs/aspect-ratios).

## The test page

This is the whole page. The font size comes from `--vh`, so the text scales with the frame. One rule changes the layout for `9:16`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="duration" content="3">
<style>
  body { margin: 0; background: #0b0d12; color: #f4f6fb; font: 700 calc(var(--vh) * 0.09) system-ui; }
  .card { position: absolute; inset: 0; display: grid; place-content: center; padding: 0 8%; }
  h1 { margin: 0; line-height: 1.05; animation: rise 0.6s cubic-bezier(.2,.9,.2,1) both 0.3s; }
  p { margin: 0.4em 0 0; font-size: 0.45em; color: #4f7cff; animation: rise 0.6s cubic-bezier(.2,.9,.2,1) both 0.6s; }
  @keyframes rise { from { transform: translateY(calc(var(--vh) * 0.03)); opacity: 0 } to { transform: none; opacity: 1 } }
  [data-aspect="9:16"] h1 { font-size: 1.15em; }
  [data-aspect="9:16"] .card { place-content: start; padding-top: 30%; }
</style>
<div class="card" data-world="title"><h1>One page,<br>every ratio</h1><p id="r"></p></div>
<script>
  document.getElementById('r').textContent = document.documentElement.dataset.aspect + ' · ' + window.vawe.width + ' x ' + window.vawe.height;
</script>
```

Add `<meta charset="utf-8">`. Our first run left it out, and the dot in the label came out as `Â·`.

## Render each ratio

Save the page as `films/blogtest-aspect/page.html`. Then render a draft with the `--aspect` flag:

```bash
bin/vawe dev films/blogtest-aspect/page.html --aspect 9:16
```

We ran this for four ratios. Each draft is 90 frames at 30 fps. The command printed these lines:

| Flag | What `vawe dev` printed | Time |
|---|---|---|
| `--aspect 16:9` | 960x540 (16:9) | 4.2 s |
| `--aspect 9:16` | 540x960 (9:16) | 5.5 s |
| `--aspect 1:1` | 540x540 (1:1) | 4.0 s |
| `--aspect 4:3` | 720x540 (4:3) | 4.1 s |

A draft is half size. The label inside the page reads the full size from `window.vawe`: 1920 x 1080, 1080 x 1920 and 1080 x 1080.

The fifth ratio, `4:5`, failed in our run. The half-size draft is 540 by 675 pixels, and the encoder stops with "height not divisible by 2". We report it as a bug in the draft path. We did not test a final at `4:5`.

## Three stills

Each still is one frame at 1.8 seconds, cut from the draft with ffmpeg.

![The test page at 16:9: two lines of text and the label 16:9 · 1920 x 1080](/blog/html-video-aspect-ratios/16x9.webp "16:9 draft, 960 by 540")

</figure>

<figure>

![The test page at 9:16: four short lines of text stacked on the left, and the label 9:16 · 1080 x 1920](/blog/html-video-aspect-ratios/9x16.webp "9:16 draft, 540 by 960, with the 9:16 rule")

</figure>

<figure>

![The test page at 1:1: three lines of text and the label 1:1 · 1080 x 1080](/blog/html-video-aspect-ratios/1x1.webp "1:1 draft, 540 by 540")

</figure>

The 1:1 frame needed no rule of its own. The font size follows `--vh`, and the text wraps inside the padding.

## Render every ratio in one command

The docs describe `bin/vawe ship <page> --aspect all`, which writes one file per ratio. We did not run it: `ship` needs an approved draft and makes full-size files. We ran drafts only. The page contract lives in [the page contract](/blog/page-contract), and each ratio is its own reproducible render ([determinism](/blog/determinism)).

## FAQ

**How do I make a vertical video from HTML?**
Render the page with `--aspect 9:16`, and add a `[data-aspect="9:16"]` rule for anything that needs a new layout. The renderer sets the frame size to 1080 by 1920 for a final.

**Why does `--vh` not work with `px`?**
`--vh` already holds the unit, for example `1080px`. Write `calc(var(--vh) * 0.09)`.

**Does vawe crop the page for other ratios?**
No. It renders the page again at the new size, so your CSS decides the layout.

**Which ratios exist?**
`16:9`, `9:16`, `1:1`, `4:5` and `4:3`. The film pipeline delivers 16:9 only.
