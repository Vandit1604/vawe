# Brand art

Two-ink screenprint scenes painted in canvas 2D (`art.js`, seeded, so each render is the same image)
with the copy and layout in `page.js`. One page per format: `banner.html` (2:1), `og.html` (1200:630),
`post.html` (16:9), `square.html` (1:1). Pick the image with the query: `scene`, `ink` (`a` blue print,
`b` night print) and `copy` (the keys of `COPY` in `page.js`).

Each repo gets its own scene, never one used for another repo:

| Scene | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `lanes` | timeline towers along a road to the star (vawe) |
| `pages` | page stacks seen from above, the film frame glowing below |
| `strip` | a page that runs on as a filmstrip under frame gates (the org) |
| `stair` | six skill cards hung as a stair that climbs to the star (skills) |
| `search` | a night city of page towers; searchlights sweep, one lands on the cited page (AI search visibility) |
| `catalog` | an endless card-catalogue wall, one drawer open, the figure brings a card (skills directories) |
| `cinema` | a projector beam through haze onto a huge screen with the star in the film (agent video) |

Render from the repo root with `bin/vawe still assets/brand-art/<format>.html --at 0 --param scene=<s> --param ink=<i> --param copy=<c>`.
Add `--size 1280x640` to a banner for a GitHub social preview.
