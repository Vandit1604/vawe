// Views, camera movements, backdrop and depth cue for filming a screen as a product shot: data and pure helpers next to lens.js, which owns the camera.
// No second way to tilt. A view is a pose of the plane (rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ, zoom); a movement is a start and an end drawn from seeded ranges.
// Angles are degrees as CSS reads them: rotateX above 0 tips the top edge away, rotateY above 0 turns the right edge away. lensPose() turns a pose into lens options.
//
// Source of the numbers: a measured study of a product-shot tool's presets (read-only, 2026-10-19). Its four perspective presets are VIEWS below (x/y/z of 15/-45/0, 30/45/0,
// 65/0/-45, -20/45/0, zoom 125 percent). Its screen movements are MOVES: each rotation is a seeded range, a direction sign drawn once per move, and every
// rotateX and rotateY it applies is clamped to +-25 degrees, which is CLAMP_DEG here. The ranges of its screen generator are copied as they are; where its end
// state adds a random -[0,14] degrees of pitch and -[0,24] of yaw on top of the named end, that noise is dropped so a move settles. Zoom is its percent change
// divided by 100.
